Description: This package provides all code used to perform and
    summarize the simulation study shown in our paper "Estimation after
    blinded interim analysis". The code for the general simulations is
    provided in the vignettes 'SimulateBias' and 'CaseStudy'. Rebuilding
    the vignettes will use saved results to redraw all the graphics from
    the paper. In order to rerun the simulations the corresponding code
    chunks need to be configured for evaluation. NOTE: although this
    package will run on Windows it has been optimized for Linux recomputing
    the simulation results may not work.
